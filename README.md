## 🛠️ Technologies

| Technology | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Python 3.12** | Application runtime |
| **FastAPI + Uvicorn** | Stremio API, streaming endpoints, and debug server |
| **Telethon** | Telegram user authentication and channel access |
| **SQLite FTS5** | Persistent index and full-text search |
| **HTTPX** | Asynchronous HTTP requests |
| **Docker Compose** | Standalone container deployment |
| **Home Assistant Supervisor** | Add-on installation, configuration, and lifecycle |

Videos stream through your server without transcoding. Playback compatibility depends on the codecs supported by your Stremio device.

## 📂 Folder layout

> **Application code lives in `stremio_addon/`. Home Assistant packaging lives in `addon/`.**

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `stremio_addon/` | Core Stremio application: API, Telegram integration, indexing, streaming, and debug dashboard |
| `addon/` | Home Assistant package: configuration, startup wrapper, Dockerfile, documentation, and changelog |
| `addon/config.yaml` | Home Assistant options, supported architecture, image, and version |
| `tests/` | Automated application and release tests |
| `scripts/` | Release version and changelog tooling |
| `generate_session.py` | Interactive Telegram session generator |
| `repository.json` | Home Assistant custom repository metadata |

The container build copies `stremio_addon/` into its internal `addon` Python package. Both installation methods run the same application.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Set these values in `.env` for Docker Compose. In Home Assistant, enter the corresponding options in the add-on's **Configuration** tab.

**Mandatory** is a boolean: `true` means you must supply a value; `false` means a default is available.

| Environment variable | Description | Mandatory | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| `addon_url` | Base URL reachable by Stremio; use HTTPS for deployment. May include a path prefix, but no credentials, query, or fragment. | `true` | — | `https://telegram.example.com` |
| `api_key` | Access key with at least 32 characters: letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens. Generate a unique value. | `true` | — | Generate with the command below |
| `api_id` | Positive Telegram application ID. | `true` | — | `123456` |
| `api_hash` | Telegram application hash. | `true` | — | `YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_HASH` |
| `user_session_string` | Complete authorized Telethon StringSession from the session generator. | `true` | — | `YOUR_TELETHON_STRING_SESSION` |
| `port` | Main application listener port. | `false` | `8000` | `8000` |
| `debug_enabled` | Enable the separate debug dashboard. | `false` | `true` | `false` |
| `debug_port` | Dashboard port; must differ from `port` when enabled. | `false` | `8001` | `8001` |
| `debug_host` | Dashboard bind address. Keep the default for Docker port forwarding. | `false` | `0.0.0.0` | `0.0.0.0` |
| `cache_mb` | Disk chunk-cache limit in MiB; `0` disables new cache writes. | `false` | `512` | `1024` |
| `CHANNEL_IDS` | Comma-separated negative IDs limiting which joined private broadcast channels are indexed. Blank selects all eligible channels. | `false` | Empty | `-1001234567890,-1009876543210` |
| `data_dir` | Persistent index and cache directory. Home Assistant manages this automatically; it is not a UI option. | `false` | `/data` standalone; `/data/stremio` in Home Assistant | `/data` |

Use the variable names shown above. The application also accepts uppercase equivalents for lowercase settings, with nonempty lowercase values taking precedence. `CHANNEL_IDS` takes precedence over its lowercase alias. The supplied Compose port mappings use lowercase `port` and `debug_port`.

### 🎯 Selecting channels

Leave `CHANNEL_IDS` empty to discover all joined private broadcast channels, including archived dialogs. To limit indexing, copy the full negative channel IDs from the protected status endpoint into `CHANNEL_IDS`, then restart.

Selecting a channel does not join it. Public channels and groups are excluded. Removing a channel from the selection removes its indexed entries when discovery runs; selecting it again starts a fresh history scan.

## 🔑 Prepare your credentials

Complete this once before either installation method.

### 1. Get Telegram application credentials

Sign in at [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org), open **API development tools**, and obtain your **API ID** and **API hash**.

### 2. Download the project

On a trusted computer with Git and Python 3.12:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hilayc/stremio-addon.git
cd stremio-addon
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

| Platform | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Linux / macOS | `source .venv/bin/activate` |
| Windows PowerShell | `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` |

Install dependencies and generate the session:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python generate_session.py
```

Enter your API credentials, phone number, Telegram login code, and two-step verification password if requested. Save the generated value as `user_session_string`.

### 3. Generate an addon access key

```sh
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Save the output as `api_key`.

> 🔐 Keep the session string, API key, and installation URL private. Use a dedicated session for this addon and run only one instance with that session.

## 🐳 Install with Docker Compose

**You need:** Docker Engine with Docker Compose, the project checkout, and the credentials prepared above.

### 1. Configure the environment

From the repository root, copy the example:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows PowerShell, use `Copy-Item .env.example .env`.

Edit `.env` and replace the placeholders:

```dotenv
port=8000
addon_url=https://telegram.example.com
api_key=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GENERATED_ACCESS_KEY
api_id=123456
api_hash=YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_HASH
user_session_string=YOUR_TELETHON_STRING_SESSION

debug_enabled=true
debug_port=8001
debug_host=0.0.0.0
cache_mb=512
# CHANNEL_IDS=-1001234567890,-1009876543210
```

### 2. Build and start

The included `compose.yaml` is ready to use:

```yaml
services:
  addon:
    build: .
    env_file: .env
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:${port:-8000}:${port:-8000}"
      - "127.0.0.1:${debug_port:-8001}:${debug_port:-8001}"
    volumes:
      - telegram-data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL

volumes:
  telegram-data:
```

```sh
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose logs -f addon
```

The named volume preserves the index and cache across container restarts and rebuilds.

### 3. Configure HTTPS

The supplied Compose configuration publishes both ports on the Docker host's loopback interface. Point a reverse proxy running on that host at `127.0.0.1:8000`.

For example, with Caddy installed on the host:

```caddyfile
telegram.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8000
}
```

Point the domain's DNS to your server and make ports 80 and 443 reachable by Caddy. Set `addon_url` to the matching HTTPS base URL.

Preserve Range headers, allow long streaming requests, and disable proxy caching and response buffering. Avoid access logs containing the full credential-bearing URL. If using a URL prefix, strip that prefix before forwarding to the application.

If the proxy runs in another container, connect both services to a shared Docker network and forward to `addon:8000`.

### 4. Connect Stremio

Paste this address into Stremio's addon installation field, replacing the domain and key:

```text
https://telegram.example.com/YOUR_API_KEY/manifest.json
```

Initial indexing runs in the background, so results fill in as the scan progresses.

### 🔄 Update a Compose installation

From the repository directory:

```sh
git pull --ff-only
docker compose up --build -d
```

## 🏠 Install with Home Assistant

**You need:** a Home Assistant installation with the add-on store and an **amd64 / x86-64** host. The current Home Assistant package does not declare ARM support.

### 1. Add the custom repository

Open **Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store**, then open the **⋮** menu and choose **Repositories**.

Paste this URL and select **Add**:

```text
https://github.com/hilayc/stremio-addon
```

You can also use this shortcut:

[![Add repository to Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhilayc%2Fstremio-addon)

### 2. Install the add-on

Find **Stremio Telegram** in the add-on store and select **Install**. Refresh the store if it has not appeared yet.

### 3. Configure it

Open the add-on's **Configuration** tab. Enter the credentials from [Prepare your credentials](#-prepare-your-credentials), along with your external URL.

Example YAML configuration:

```yaml
port: 8000
addon_url: "https://telegram.example.com"
api_key: "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_GENERATED_ACCESS_KEY"
api_id: 123456
api_hash: "YOUR_TELEGRAM_API_HASH"
user_session_string: "YOUR_TELETHON_STRING_SESSION"
debug_enabled: true
debug_port: 8001
debug_host: "0.0.0.0"
cache_mb: 512
CHANNEL_IDS: ""
```

Save the configuration. Enable **Start on boot**, start the add-on, and check its **Log** tab.

Home Assistant stores application data in `/data/stremio`. Restart the add-on after changing configuration.

### 4. Configure the connection

The add-on uses **host networking**. Choose unused ports, and point your HTTPS reverse proxy at:

```text
http://HOME_ASSISTANT_IP:8000
```

Use the proxy settings described in the Docker section. The Stremio endpoint must be reachable by your client; Home Assistant ingress is not used.

Install the addon in Stremio with:

```text
https://telegram.example.com/YOUR_API_KEY/manifest.json
```

### 5. Open the dashboard

With `debug_enabled: true`, select **Open Web UI** on the add-on page and sign in with your `api_key`.

The button currently targets port **8001**. If you change `debug_port`, open `http://HOME_ASSISTANT_IP:YOUR_DEBUG_PORT` directly.

## 🧰 Debug dashboard

The dashboard runs on its own listener and works independently of `addon_url`.

| Installation | Default dashboard address |
| --- | --- |
| Docker Compose, opened on the Docker host | `http://127.0.0.1:8001` |
| Home Assistant | `http://HOME_ASSISTANT_IP:8001` |

For a remote Docker host, use an SSH tunnel to reach the loopback-bound dashboard:

```sh
ssh -L 8001:127.0.0.1:8001 user@YOUR_DOCKER_HOST
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8001` locally.

- **🔌 Connection:** inspect Telegram connection and indexing state.
- **📋 Channels:** see which channels are included in queries.
- **🔎 Search:** inspect matching results and diagnostic details without playback.
- **👁️ Credentials:** reveal or hide the API key while entering it.
- **🔄 Sync now:** trigger channel discovery and catch-up indexing after joining a channel or adding a video.
- **📝 Activity:** review recent addon activity.

For connection and indexing details, use the protected endpoint:

```text
https://telegram.example.com/YOUR_API_KEY/status
```

The `/healthz` endpoint checks that the HTTP server is running; it does not confirm Telegram readiness.
